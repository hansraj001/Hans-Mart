The foundation of this project revolves around an intricately designed system using ASP.NET MVC, seamlessly integrated with a robust SQL Server database. The project is thoughtfully divided into two key components: the Admin side and the User side.

On the Admin side, empowered administrators wield the ability to effortlessly add, update, and delete products. This streamlined control ensures a dynamic and responsive management of the product catalog. Meanwhile, the User side offers a user-friendly interface that caters to a seamless shopping experience.

Users are treated to an array of functionalities, notably the ability to explore diverse product categories such as shoes and clothes. The intuitive design allows users to effortlessly navigate through the platform, selecting products of interest and seamlessly adding them to their cart. The subsequent steps in the user journey mirror the familiar and trusted processes found in other leading e-commerce platforms.

This meticulously crafted project strikes a harmonious balance between administrative control and user convenience, delivering a sophisticated and enjoyable online shopping experience.
